Notwithstanding (notwithstanding)	<b><u>Notwithstanding</u></b> possible problems with the testability of the model, a ‘levels of processing’ approach does – importantly – draw attention to important functional issues including a) the type of processing of materials at the time of encoding, b) elaboration of materials during encoding, and c) the appropriateness of the processing that takes place at the time of encoding (in terms of ‘transfer’ to the later memory task; this issue will be considered further in Chapter 3). <br><hr>美[.nɑtwɪð&apos;stændɪŋ]，英[.nɒtwɪð&apos;stændɪŋ]，prep. 尽管；虽然； conj. 尽管； adv. 尽管如此； 网络释义： 尽管虽然；还是；仍然；
elaboration (elaborate)	1) In Bartlett’s own words, memory retains ‘a little outstanding detail’, while the remainder of what we remember represents an <b><u>elaboration</u></b> that is merely influenced by the original event. <br>2) Further semantic processing, involving <b><u>elaboration</u></b> based on the meaning of the word, represents deeper processing, and should lead to better memory (for example, we might think about different breeds of dog, where they originate, their original functional roles, the characteristics of the breed, and so on). <br><hr>美[ɪ&apos;læb(ə)rət]，英[ɪ&apos;læbəreɪt]，v. 精心制作；详尽阐述；详细描述；详细制订； adj. 复杂的；详尽的；精心制作的； 网络释义： 精心设计的；精心构思的；精心的；

experimentation (experimentation)	The study described in the last paragraph represents a good example of how carefully defined <b><u>experimentation</u></b> can help us to establish a key difference between mental processes that we would be unable to separate reliably using self-reflection or introspection. <br><hr>美[ɪk.sperɪmen&apos;teɪʃ(ə)n]，英[ɪk.sperɪmen&apos;teɪʃ(ə)n]，n. 实验；试验； 网络释义： 实验法；实验研究；实验过程；

conflate (conflate)	In fact, we often combine and <b><u>conflate</u></b> episodic and semantic memory without being aware that we are doing so; for example, when trying to recall what happened on our wedding day, our actual recollections of the day may well be combined with our expectations and semantic knowledge abut the kinds of things that typically happen at weddings. <br><hr>美[kən&apos;fleɪt]，英[kən&apos;fleɪt]，v. 合并；合成；混合； 网络释义： 异文融合；合并v；酏接；

rigour (rigour)	The risk from such an approach is that – although we are employing scientific <b><u>rigour</u></b>, and are able to partition the mechanisms of memory into tractable chunks – we may be eliminating those very aspects of human memory that are most intrinsic to (and definitive of) the way our memory functions in everyday life. <br><hr>美[&apos;rɪɡə]，英[&apos;rɪɡə(r)]，n. 严格；严厉；艰苦；严酷； 网络释义： 严谨；苛刻；严密；
